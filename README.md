# Kaggle_Titanic

Kaggle is hosting a machine learning competition for beginners using information about the Titanic.
The dataset includes a variety of information for various passengers, and we are tasked with creating a model that
can predict whether or not individual passengers survived.

I created a random forest model that achieved an accuracy of 78% on an unseen testset.

This was my first competition in Kaggle and I used some of the methods from a recommended tutorial.
